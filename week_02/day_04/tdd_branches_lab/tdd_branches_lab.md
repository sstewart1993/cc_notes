# TDD & Branching Lab

## Learning Objective

- Practice problem solving with TDD & branching


## Task

You have 3 problems to solve. **High Scores**, **Matrix** and **Compound Interest Calculator**.

Take a copy of the ```start_code``` directory and rename it to ```tdd_branching_lab```

Initialise your directory with Git:

```
cd tdd_branching_lab
git init
```

Using the start code, write your test, get it to fail and then get it to pass. Repeat.

Each problem should have it's own branch. So for example, before you start work on the Matrix problem, move onto a new branch called feature/matrix.

Once all the tests pass, merge it back onto your master branch. If not all of the tests pass, don't merge into master.
