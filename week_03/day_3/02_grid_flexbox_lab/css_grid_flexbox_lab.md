# CSS Grid and Flexbox Lab

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a complex web design using HTML and CSS with Grid and/or Flexbox
- Be able to apply aesthetic CSS rules to a web page

## MVP

In this lab you will create the HTML structure and  styling for the following travel web page.

<img src="images/cctravel.png" width="250" >

The page will have
- Header with navigation
- Grid of favourite/top places
- A form to find travel details
- A grid showing popular countries to visit
- A grid showing popular places to visit in certain countries.
- Testimonials from users
- Footer showing some company details.

The links shown do not have to do anything and the page does not have to look exactly like our examples. However you want to style it is fine as long as you apply appropriate HTML and CSS.


Alternatively if a travel lab doesn't float your boat then feel free to come up with your own idea!

Your idea must have similar structure to the above example though and display good use of Css Grid and/or Flexbox.

Feel free to discuss ideas with a member of your instructor team.

### Extensions

Add some more pages to the site. (about, contact, blog, you choose!), and link to them via the navigation bar.

These should have the same navigation area and overall theme of the main page. (You want users to know they are still on your website!)

### Advanced Extensions!

Use Media Queries and make the main page responsive!

## Getting Started

It is highly recommended that you start by breaking the design down into boxes. You can then start to decide which order to create each box in the HTML and consider how its contents should be structured.
