* Know the role of a developer in relation to UX Design

## Differences Between UX & UI

People often think that UI and UX are one and the same and use the two terms interchangeably.

> 1. Can you give me an example of what an User Interface is?
> 2. What is a user experience?

UI stands for user interface. It's the buttons, menus, text, images and generally elements that users can interact with. This also includes their layout or the way they are styled.

UX stands for user experience. User experience refers to any interaction a user has with a product or service.

It is very important to understand that although UX and UI are not the same they do go hand in hand.

Imagine that I recommend you a book and you want to buy it what is the first step you'd take?

> 1. Open the browser.
> 2. Ask: how would we go about this? Please, guide me.

All of this constitutes an experience. Just think of the number of people and technologies involved in making this happen. All these servers and websites run some kind of code. There are countless teams of visual designers, front-end and back-end developers, project managers, information architects, system operatives, administrators and others working on software and hardware we use every day.

Experience doesn't start and end on the website; it continues when the user interacts with the product or service they purchased, through continuous use, marketing communication, support and many other activities.



## User Experience Design

<!--User experience Design is a discipline that deals with understanding how an experience is formed through a sum of its parts. In other words, what are users's requirements, ideas and expectations towards the software that's written.-->

Most working software development organisations will

1. Work in an user-centric way, ie it puts the needs of the user first.
2. Develop products accordingly to well-researched specifications
3. Strive to make software that is not only easy to use, but friendly and desirable.

All of this is achieved with the help of multidisciplinary area of digital expertise, called user experience design.


## Role of a Developer

At this point you're probably wondering how a software developer is involved with User Experience Design. It is becoming more and more apparent that programmers who create code are also responsible for the end experience and you will often be working with other colleagues on the many stages of a products lifecycle.

As a developer, you will need to understand how to ask questions about your requirements, to make sure that you can understand what are needs of those that your product is for. It will also be helpful to you if you understood how business requirements can shape the face of your future application or a website.

## Why are we learning this?

You're here because you want to learn to code. During the course we teach both backend and frontend programming but many of your works will be surfacing as products that other people can interact with. That's why over the course you will learn about:

* User needs and user journey mapping,
* Basics of interface design,
* Methods for efficient group collaboration.

3. Note down as you go anything that stands out to you as bad UX.
