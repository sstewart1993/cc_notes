# Requirements Gathering

## Learning Objectives

* Importance of establishing user and business needs
* Importance of documenting user needs
* The process of user and business needs information gathering

## Establishing needs

### User needs
User needs have to be documented, since they can be evolving over time, or new needs can arise from old ones. For instance, if you make an app that allows its users to track calories in their diet, you might want to add a function later that allows them to measure their bodyweight. Having this documented helps the continuous development of your product.

### Business needs
Business needs are organisational needs. For example, an organisation might want to drive its revenue by increasing sales of a particular product. An organisation might also want to inform users (clients) about news regarding a new product development, and for that they might need to publish a blogpost.

Whilst this might look like a thing that isn't relevant to software developers, it is affecting their working life quite a lot. First of all, business needs, together with user needs, dictate software requirements. Using the previous example — someone's got to build that blog. And clients will be using it.



## User stories

Once you understand what your needs are, it is helpful to map them as user stories. User stories are a set of simple statements that describe why someone wants to do something. They are written from the perspective of a user, use simple language that express needs and don't specify solutions.

User stories often follow this format:

```
As a ...[type of user]
I need ...[something]
So I can ...[do the thing i need to do]
```

For example:

```
As an ATM user in a hurry
I need to withdraw money from an ATM in as few steps as possible
So that it is quick and takes me little time
```

Well written user stories will help you:

* keep track of everything you need to do
* think about your work from a user’s perspective
* prioritise your work


## Documenting user needs

User needs have to be documented, since they can be evolving over time, or new needs can arise from old ones. For instance, if you make an app that allows its users to track calories in their diet, you might want to add a function later that allows them to measure their bodyweight. Having this documented helps the continuous development of your product.

In programming you will find many options of documenting user needs, and even solutions that would allow you to test your code on the basis of established needs, however at the beginning a simple text file is more than adequate.


### User needs exercise

Define your target group. Who are they?
Give them a description, for example:

```
Target group: tourists
Description:  backpackers, travelling on short holiday, often looking for most cost-effective solution. 
They use smartphones to locate themselves and take photographs during their trip.
```

Think of their goal. What is it that they're trying to achieve? Think of individual goals. There's only one goal per one user need (otherwise it'd become hard to document).

```
Goal: satisfying their hunger, so they could spend more time walking.
```

What is their need, then? A single need for a single goal.

```
Need: finding a restaurant that matches their budget.
```
Now please, everyone in your groups:

```
[Task 10mins] 

* define your target group
* define their goals (one goal per one user need)
* define their needs in relation to their goals

come up with five or six user needs for your app and your target groups.
```
> Discuss 

## Recap


* User and business needs are ways of articulating requirements.
* Following the sample format we can gather and document user and business needs that later evolve during projects.
