# CSS Layout

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of CSS Flexbox
- Understand the role of CSS Grid
- Understand some of the key differences between Flexbox and Grid

## Introduction

Tomorrow we will learn how to position elements on a web page using CSS to create specific layouts. We will be using two CSS modules to achieve this - Flexbox and Grid.

Before we learn how to use either of these modules, it's a good idea to first understand what purpose they serve, and how they differ from each other.

## Flexbox

Flexbox was designed to distribute elements within a container into rows OR columns. This can be useful for distrubuting content within sections of a web page, for example:

- positioning the logo and nav elements within a header
- positioning links within a nav
- positioning images within a gallery

## Grid

Grid was designed to distribute elements within a container into rows AND columns. This can be useful for controlling the overall layout of a page, or more complex arrangements of elements within a part of a page.
