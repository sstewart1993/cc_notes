# Flipped Lesson 

For this homework you will read through the lesson on working with a Python class and a database. We are not expecting you to code along with the lesson, but rather to spend this time to try and understand what is happening and why.

We've provided the end code for you to follow along:

- Follow along with the [Single Model With Databases Lesson](single_model_with_db.md) and read the code along with it to help your understanding.

- As you go through the lesson, note down any questions/observations you have and we'll go through them in the homework review tomorrow.
